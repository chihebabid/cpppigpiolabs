# cpppigpiolabs
C++ labs based on pigpio for Raspberry Pi


This repository contains labs developed with C++ and are based on the pigpio library. Mainly, the C++17 standard is used in order to modern implemntations. Several labs contain class utilities that can be integrated into a library allowing to ease the development of complex projects. Maybe, in near future, I'll propose a complete library for different peripherals.

Programs are tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and using the latest distribution Rasperry OS 5.4.
